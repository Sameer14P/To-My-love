# 💍 To my Lovely, Suku? 💖

Hey my love,

From the very first moment we met, I knew deep down that you were my forever. You are my light in the darkest hours, my calm in every storm, my world, my home, my everything. I love you to the moon and back, endlessly and truly. I wish you a beautiful journey ahead—a flourishing career, glowing health, and boundless joy. With all my love, Sameer.

With all my love,  
**Sameer ❤️**
